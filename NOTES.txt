A reducer is a function that updates state


We are setting up a backend API with Node.js and MongoDB

We want to use our own node server with mongodb
In the backend, we'll validate our user token using firebase admin so the app is secure. 
Once we implement firebase admin in the backend, when a user registers or logs in we will create or update the user in mongodb. 


Then we'll tweek login/register so that when a user logs in, the response is from the backend. 

Backend dependencies:
express
body-parser
mongoose
cors
morgan 
express-jwt
firebase-admin
jsonwebtoken
nodemon
dotenv

The Backend dev flow in the server.js file
1. Import all your packages with require()
2. Run the app with express()
3. Connect to the db with mongoose.connect()
4. Setup your middleware with app.use()
5. Set up your routes with app.get()
6. Set up your port with the const port = process.env.PORT and app.listen()
